Hello! I am Prajwal, a second year MRSD student at Carnegie Mellon University!
I am interested in robot perception, physical intelligence, and generalization in neural architectures, with the goal of expediting real-world deployment of robotic systems.<br><br>
My past work includes research in domain generalization for computer vision in autonomous vehicles and semantic segmentation of satellite imagery.
During my tenure as a Resarch Assistant at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab, [(AIRL)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics-laboratory/posts/?feedView=all), Indian Institute of Science [(IISc)](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/), I was advised by Prof. [Suresh Sundaram](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5iAMbhMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My work primarily focused on projects involving computer vision and robotics.<br><br>

Recently, at CMU I have been working on general autonomy and long-horizon tasks for humanoids.
